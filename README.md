# Stanley Cuberick

> A small sideproject to see how game development in Unity works. It taught me how to think a bit differently and out of the box than what is given in the current programming course.
>  
>
> *This project shows my adventurous spirit and dumb humor. I would love to get more into Unity, but I will focus on finishing my bigger priorities first.*

## Excersise outline

This project was created with the help of a Brackeys tutorial, so this code is not super original, but it does reflect my style of coding.
Like mentioned above, I would love to get into Unity someday, but school is the bigger priority right now.
